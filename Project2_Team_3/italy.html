                    <p>By: Anonymous User<br>Est. time to read: 5 mins</p>
                    <p>We were lucky in that the appliances in the home had been recently replaced and I liked them.  I had specific needs for appliances - I wanted a large side-by-side fridge, two ovens and a 6-burner range.  And this house had all of those.   That was lucky because of all the backordered appliances during Covid, so I got to avoid that frustration. </p>

                        <p>5. Tradition and Family:<br>
