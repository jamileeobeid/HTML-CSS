        <h3>The History of Indian Cuisine</h3>
        <p>
          Indian cuisine has a rich and diverse history influenced by various cultures, regions, and eras. Agriculture in India began around 8000 BCE in North Rajasthan and developed through the Indus Valley civilization, introducing barley, wheat, and pulses. During the Vedic era (1500–600 BCE), Ayurvedic principles shaped dietary habits, emphasizing harmony and balance. The rise of Jainism and Buddhism (6th–1st century BCE) promoted vegetarianism, while the Gupta Empire (1st–5th century CE) expanded spice trade, including with the Roman Empire.

          Puranic Hinduism introduced the concept of prasad, and Islamic influence began with Arab traders and flourished during the Mughal era, adding dishes like biryani and tandoori. The Portuguese (16th century) brought staples like chili and potatoes, while the British popularized tea, all contributing to India's vibrant culinary heritage.
